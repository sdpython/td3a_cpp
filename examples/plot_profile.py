Profile a function
==================

:epkg:`pyinstrument` is a profiler for :epkg:`python` functions.
It tells how long the program stays in every function.
Because numerical functions are usually very short,
it is usually helpful to call them multiple times
before the cause becomes significant.

# At the end, the profiler is able to approximatvely tell
# how long the program stayed in every function.
# If a function does not appear, it means it was never executed
# or too fast to be caught.
# An HTML report can be generated.
